## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Delta 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Delta 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Delta 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the z1-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z1-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the z2-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z2-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z3-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z3-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT:
### Base :
The base refers to the stationary bottom platform on which the printer is mounted. It is the foundation that provides stability and support for the entire printer structure.

### Holder :
A holder refers to a component or structure that is designed to hold or secure specific parts or components of the printer. There can be different types of holders in a delta 3D printer, each serving a specific purpose.

### Rod :
Rods, also known as arms or linkages, are key components that connect the printer's effector (toolhead or extruder assembly) to the base. They provide the structural framework for the printer's movement system, enabling precise and controlled motion in three-dimensional space.

### Top cover :
The top cover in a delta 3D printer refers to a protective or enclosing structure that is placed on the upper part of the printer.

### Top cover frame :
The top cover frame in a delta 3D printer refers to the structure or framework that supports and holds the top cover in place. It provides the necessary stability and rigidity to the cover while allowing for easy access to the printer's working area when needed.

### Linear rail :
Linear rails, also known as linear guides or linear motion systems, are components used in delta 3D printers to facilitate smooth and precise linear movement of various printer components.

### Motor :
Motors play a crucial role in driving the movement of the printer's components, enabling precise positioning and control. There are typically several motors used in a delta 3D printer, each serving a specific function.

### Base :
The base refers to the stationary bottom platform on which the printer is mounted. It is the foundation that provides stability and support for the entire printer structure.

### Bed :
The bed refers to the platform on which the object being printed is built. It is the surface where the printing process takes place. The bed is typically a flat and level platform that moves vertically to accommodate the height of the printed object.

### Slide with connector :
A connector that attaches the bed to the printer's frame.

### Connecting Rods :
In a delta 3D printer, connecting rods, also known as linkage rods, are an essential component of the printer's mechanical structure. Connecting rods are typically three elongated rods that connect the printer's effector (toolhead or extruder assembly) to the base or carriages.

### Extruder :
The extruder is a critical component responsible for feeding and controlling the filament used for printing. It is the part of the printer that pushes or pulls the filament into the hotend, where it is melted and deposited layer by layer to create the 3D printed object.

### Pins :
In a delta 3D printer, pins can refer to various components or elements that are used in the printer's construction or assembly.

### Motor with gear :
In a delta 3D printer, a motor with gear refers to a motor that is equipped with a gear or a gear reduction system. This type of motor is commonly used in the printer's extruder assembly to drive the filament feed mechanism.

### LCD :
An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) refers to a display panel that is used to provide visual feedback and user interface capabilities. The LCD is typically integrated into the control interface of the printer, allowing users to interact with the printer and access various settings and functions.
